# Caesar-encrypt-decrypt-project
 
Here is a little project I wanted to try. It was in a list of good Cybersecurity porfolio projects to try out so I decided to try to make a Caesar encrypt/decrypt script.

In the beginning it was very basic but I decided to instead of only having the script I also wanted to have some functionalities where I could use the program indefinitly until I decided to quit it. I created a menu with print statements and added a while loop so the terminal would continue asking for new input to decrypt/encrypt.
